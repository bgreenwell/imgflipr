# imgflipr

The goal of imgflipr is to, you guessed it, interact with the official [Imgflip API](https://api.imgflip.com/) through R.

## Installation

Currently, you can only install this packaghe from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bgreenwell/imgflipr")
```

## Example

Grab a tibble of the most popular memes:

```{r example}
memes <- imgflipr::get_memes()
memes
```

Grab the ID for a marticular image:

```{r memes}
batman <- memes[memes$name == "Batman Slapping Robin", "id"]
```

Caption this image (note, I have my [Imgflip](https://imgflip.com/) username and password stored as an environment variable in my `.Renviron` file:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
imgflipr::caption_image(
  template_id = batman, 
  username = Sys.getenv("IMGFLIP_USERNAME"), 
  password = Sys.getenv("IMGFLIP_PASSWORD"), 
  text0 = "Damn it, Robin",
  browse = FALSE  # don't open the captioned image in a browser
)
```

For now, just visit the link to your captioned image, it's that easy!
